# How to Give an Excellent Presentation Checklist

_Write answers to the following questions._

## General
1. What is the question you will address?
2. Why will it be relevant to the audience?
3. What’s the “punchline” of the solution(s) to the question? i.e. what’s the “elevator pitch” of your presentation?
4. What would you like to achieve (e.g. teach, learn, persuade) via the creation & delivery of this presentation?

## Specific
1. What’s your opening sentence(s)?
2. What’s your concluding sentences(s)?
3. What are the different sections of your presentation?
4. How many core “points” (if using Powerpoint, these might also be “slides”) would you like to share? What are they?
5. Generally speaking, orient each point/slide around the exploration of a question.

## Delivery
- Look each audience member in the eye as you speak your opening sentence.
- Place your hands at your side or steeple your hands. If necessary, hold an object in your hand as a reminder.
- Speak sentences purposefully and as if you are discovering them for the first time; like a Shakespearan actor on the stage. Less is more. Pause happily for a moment of silence in lieu of filler words. Alternate speed, volume and pauses to create emphasis.
- **Bonus: Memory Palace**
  1. Pick a memory villa location.
  2. Pick an exciting image for the opening sentence. Place it in the memory villa.
  3. Pick an exciting image for the concluding sentence. Place it in the memory villa.
  4. Write quick-word reminder notes for each core point/slide. Have the word-reminder notes handy for the presentation.
