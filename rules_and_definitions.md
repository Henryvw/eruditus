# Rules and Definitions

## Rules

1. A learning project stretches over four learning days
2. You need a learning partner to be able to attend
3. Phones have to be in airplane mode during learning sessions
4. If you're more than 10 min late, list the reasons and generate one action item to improve next time
5. In case of illness:
    - Case A You're the Lead Learner: Continue in your role via telephone: call the participant to walk them through their day at the library.
    - Case B You're a Participant, and a Lead Learner depends on you: Take on the role of Lead Learner, and continue as described in Case A.
    - It is also an option in case of illness to reschedule the Eruditus day. This is only possible if no one else objects and a new date works for every person participating in the current learning project.

## Definitions

### Lead Learner

You're lead learner, great! The role of the lead learner is very important and ensures the success of a learning project. As lead learner, you should take care of the following:

1. Bring contracts and ensure they are signed at the beginning of a new learning project
2. Make sure phones are in airplane mode at the start of the learning and teaching day
3. Guide students through the structure of learning and teaching days
4. Own responsibility for implementing action items after review and planning

### Learning Project

The learning project is at the heart of Eruditus. It encapsules learning days and learning sessions as well as the teaching day. It should represent a topic you want to learn more about. A learning project generally consists of four learning days and one teaching day.

### Learning Day

A learning day stretches over ~5 1/2 hours and follows this structure:

1. Check-in (~5 min)
2. Learning Session (120 min)
3. Break (90 min)
4. Learning Recap (~30 min)
5. Learning Session (90 min)

### Teaching Day

1. Finish Presentation (120 min)
2. Break (90 min)
3. Debrief (60 min)
4. Planning (15 min)
5. Presentation Session (60 min)

### Debrief

The debrief gives students a chance to give feedback and improve Eruditus. 60 minutes should be spend answering the following questions and discussing the answers.

1. What felt good/what worked?
2. What didn't work?
3. What would help us if we'd add/change it?
4. What are interesting experiments?
5. Open questions?
6. Action items
7. Current experiments

### Planning

At the very end of the teaching day, a 15 minute planning session is used to plan and implement any agreed upon improvements or experiments for the next learning project. The outcome should be set calendar dates for all participants for the next learning project.
