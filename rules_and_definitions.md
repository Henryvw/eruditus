## Definitions

### Lead Dancer

You're lead dancer, great! The role of the lead dancer is very important and ensures the success of a learning project. As lead dancer, you should take care of the following:

1. Bring contracts and ensure they are signed at the beginning of a new learning project
2. Collect and put phones in airplane mode at the start of the learning and teaching day
3. Guide students through the structure of learning and teaching days

### Learning Project

The learning project is at the heart of Eruditus. It encapsules learning days and learning sessions as well as the teaching day. It should represent a topic you want to learn more about. A learning project generally consists of four learning days and one teaching day.

### Learning Day

A learning day stretches over ~5 1/2 hours and follows this structure:

1. Standup (~5 min)
2. Learning Session (120 min)
3. Break (60 min)
4. Learning Recap (~30 min)
5. Learning Session (90 min)

### Teaching Day

1. Finish Presentation (120 min)
2. Break (60 min)
3. Debrief (60 min)
4. Planning (15 min)
5. Presentation Session (60 min)

### Debrief

The debrief gives students a chance to give feedback and improve Eruditus. 60 minutes should be spend answering the following questions and discussing the answers.

1. What felt good/what worked?
2. What didn't work?
3. What would help us if we'd change it?
4. What are interesting experiments?
5. Open questions?
6. Action items

### Planning

At the very end of the teaching day, a 15 minute planning session is used to plan and implement any agreed upon improvements or experiments for the next learning project. The outcome should be set calendar dates for all participants for the next learning project.
