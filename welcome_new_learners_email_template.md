subject: Awesome to have you join Eruditus!

Hey `NAME HERE`,

Great to have you join, it'll be awesome, I promise :)

I've sent you invites to the next sprint, please accept them to make sure you don't miss a learning or teaching day.

All you need to bring at the first teaching day is the materials you need for your studies.

Please keep in mind we're meeting at the library so you'll need a valid pass to be able to go in. This takes around 10 min. Once inside you will need to take another 10-15 min to set up internet. It's recommended to do this before the official meeting time.

Finally, for the optimal experience, please read our <a href="https://github.com/Henryvw/eruditus/blob/master/rules_and_definitions.md">rules and definitions</a> before your first learning day.

Looking forward to seeing you on `DATE, PLACE, AND TIME OF FIRST LEARNING DAY`!

Best,
`YOUR NAME`
