## 1. What felt good/what worked?
- Having a set time to work on my C64 project.
- Having a reason to give a talk about the things I've learned
- Having a deadline to learn the thing that I set out to learn
- Library setup totally works for me (reading a book)
- 4 people seems a good size
- Good structure / good crowd
- Having 4 people instead of 2 worked great. That felt good to have even a larger community around learning.
- The progress that I made in learning Ruby and thinking about it in new ways and gaining confidence.
- The library continues to be an amazing location for quiet and concentration
- Lunches with more people made for livelier conversations and community
- having a 30 min learning recap at the beginning of the second session
- presentations
- 4 people worked but not sure about more than 4 (considering presentation time)
- having lunch together
- more than 2 people splitting and doing individual sessions worked well
- timing people in the presentations for 15 min but giving them time to finish

## 2. What didn't work?
- Having my phone taken away from me.
- Having my work day start and end time being determined by when my partner showed up.
- Standups were not useful.
- No collaboration.
- Having hard stops while I was programming. Breaks are good, but hard stops break flow.
- "Cold" standup sometimes doesn't work
- Standup didn't work for reading, totally does for research etc.
- Second session sometimes too short
- 2 hours for preparing a presentation is too tight
- My punctuality; I was late 2-3 times / 5 on Friday and 1 / 4 times late on Tuesday.
- My presentation; I need to take more time to make notes alongside the slides and think about what I want to present. Maybe start already on the 2nd-to-last day to work on it
- Related to but distinct from punctuality - recognizing trade-offs between partying the night before and cognitive cost the next day at Eruditus
- Not being prepared for Learning Recap
- communication off sometimes (Christoph sick, "extra" days)
- generally second session worked better than first

## 3. What would help us if we'd add it?
- More concrete learning goals from outset, or close to the beginning of a project might provide a better framework for learning.
- More discussion at lunch about what everyone is learning.
- Ideas for punctuality
- 10 min reminder before the first learning session is up to start preparing for the review

## 4. What would help us if we'd delete it?
- No idea.
- 5 min standup in the beginning (felt useless to have it)

## 5. What would help us if we'd change it?
- Remove debrief questions 3 and 4; the answers for them can be put here.
- Teaching Day presentations should be focused on teaching something to the other people.
- Isn't adding and deleting changing?
- Once a week seems awfully slow to advance on a topic
- Maybe a 2 hour second session?
- Friday is not really great for me
- Presentation Topic
- Noticed tension around spontaneous vacations. How do we create a solution for that?
- Clarity on what the contract means in terms of attendance
- change the start time to either 10 or even later

## 6. What are interesting experiments?
- Two people could work together on a learning project.
- A teaching day without learning days.
- Values, not rules.
- Ditching standup
- Always start in the morning
- Flexible contracts - a standard contract (iOS) and then add clauses to it (apps)
- Unexpected vacation policy
- no phones during the whole day (only "emergency" phone calls)
- have presentation at the end of othe teaching day after review and planning

## 7. Open questions?
- No.
- Hard to cover an unknown topic with this free-form structure?
- Mingling doing and learning
- Curious what Ara and Christoph thought about this learning program
- Are there any systems that we've developed that are unnecessary?
- How to deal with spontaneous trips?

## 8. Action items
- [x] change 5 min standup to be optional
- [x] clarify rules to not take phones away, just put into airplane mode until lunch
- [x] switch presentation and review and planning
- [x] change contract to be more flexible on presentation
- [x] consolidate add, delete and change debrief questions to just change
- [x] upload presentations
