|----------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------| 
|**What felt good/what worked?**|- library great spot <br> - giving the presentation <br> - 1 hour break <br>- the contract worked <br> - it's a commitment but not crazy die hard (1 week skip ok) <br> - 1230 - 6ish was ok <br> - having a set spot to meet <br> - presentation at the 5th session felt right|- Just the whole thing worked amazing <br> -it's an amazing combination for me of three principles: a contract (from the Love Contract idea), a "dance partner" (from Dance Lessons) and a Gamemaster (from Dungeons and Dragons) <br> - generally being on time, with two exceptions, one caused by my dad|
|**What felt bad/didn't work?**| - showing up and starting on time <br>- schedule not clear yet (presentations in 5th meeting, plus debrief) <br> - no celebration? <br> - standups not adding a lot of value? | - the two hours sprint time might be too long |
|**What would help us if we'd add it?**| - more structure (having a set spot was good, maybe there should be more structure to things like debrief, celebration when done, having a set outline for a learning day written down) | -I could add more days right now. But not if thereâ€™s a contract.|
|**What would help us if we'd delete it?**|- Nothing|- Nothing|
|**What would help us if we'd change it?**|- Have 5 meetings instead of 4, the 5th is presentations, debrief and celebration|- Maybe time; otherwise nothing.|
|**What are interesting experiments?**|- change the study time to 90 min (or change second half to 90 min) <br> - extend the sprint to 6 weeks <br>- picking a smaller scope in a topic, trying to aim at wrapping things up after 4 learning days <br>- Actively invite people to the presentations <br>- have a week long sprint|- More dialogue in learning; <br>- Could we have even mini-presentations;<br> - Or simply you answer the question, what did I learn today?<br> - Multiple Learning Topics Running Simultaneously (for example, if we are doing 2 days a week)|
|**Open questions?**|- How to deal with longer vacations/mismatch of schedules between learning partners?|-Could this help others? <br>-Hacker News Article?<br>-Photo for the article?|
