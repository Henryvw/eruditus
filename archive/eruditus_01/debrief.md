**What felt bad/didn't work?**

_Matthias_
- showing up and starting on time
- schedule not clear yet (presentations in 5th meeting, plus debrief)
- no celebration?
- standups not adding a lot of value?

_Henry_

**What would help us if we'd add it?**

_Matthias_
- more structure (having a set spot was good, maybe there should be more structure to things like debrief, celebration when done, having a set outline for a learning day written down)

_Henry_

**What would help us if we'd delete it?**
_Matthias_
- Nothing

_Henry_
- Nothing

**What would help us if we'd change it?**
_Matthias_
- Have 5 meetings instead of 4, the 5th is presentations, debrief and celebration

_Henry_

**What are interesting experiments?**
_Matthias_
- change the study time to 90 min (or change second half to 90 min)
- extend the sprint to 6 weeks
- picking a smaller scope in a topic, trying to aim at wrapping things up after 4 learning days
- Actively invite people to the presentations
- have a week long sprint

_Henry_

**Open questions?**
- How to deal with longer vacations/mismatch of schedules between learning partners?
