What felt good/what worked?
- library great spot
- giving the presentation
- 1 hour break
- the contract worked
- it's a commitment but not crazy die hard (1 week skip ok)
- 1230 - 6ish was ok
- having a set spot to meet
- presentation at the 5th session felt right

What felt bad/didn't work?
- showing up and starting on time
- schedule not clear yet (presentations in 5th meeting, plus debrief)
- no celebration?
- standups not adding a lot of value?

What would help us if we'd add it?
- more structure (having a set spot was good, maybe there should be more structure to things like debrief, celebration when done, having a set outline for a learning day written down)

What would help us if we'd delete it?

What would help us if we'd change it?
- Have 5 meetings instead of 4, the 5th is presentations, debrief and celebration

What are interesting experiments?
- change the study time to 90 min (or change second half to 90 min)
- extend the sprint to 6 weeks
- picking a smaller scope in a topic, trying to aim at wrapping things up after 4 learning days
- Actively invite people to the presentations
- have a week long sprint

Open questions?
- How to deal with longer vacations/mismatch of schedules between learning partners?

Action items:

[x] reorganize the repo with discussed updates
