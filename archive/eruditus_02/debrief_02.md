1. What felt good/what worked?
- pleasantly surprised about digital eruditus working pretty well
- doing the learning feels good, always looking forward to it
- dealing with potential distractions beforehand worked (mom)
- presentations worked well enough despite some technical problems
- 90 min second session was good, slightly better than 120 min before that

2. What didn't work?
- just feels better doing it in person (especially lunch break and teaching day)
- while the presentations somehow worked, it's more rewarding and effective in person
- dealing with obstacles/unknowns felt harder
- more dependent on tech working (phone battery, internet on the road, etc.)
- game master seemed a little unprepared at times (might be due to digital format)

3. What would help us if we'd add it?
- Try and anticipate most common distractions?
- Have a defacto way to share screen for presentations

4. What would help us if we'd delete it?
/

5. What would help us if we'd change it?
- Game master shouldn't need to track time when remote

6. What are interesting experiments?

7. Open questions?
- How do we compare experiments? In the discussion after or fixed format where everyone thinks about it themselves?
- What to do when someone is sick?
