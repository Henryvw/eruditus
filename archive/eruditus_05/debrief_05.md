## 1. What felt good/what worked?
- 10am, half hour later made big perceived difference
- being on time!!
- knowing that we can print the contracts at the library
- finding out about the group workroom
- 4 people review
- henry's mini presentations
- jules as a guest
- feels good being able to invite people to presentations
- phones in airplane mode was good

## 2. What didn't work?
- lead dancer forgot to print out contracts
- borrowing a book that wasn't available due to construction work in the library
- not having good structure to approach a very broad topic
- 4 people review too long sometimes
- I'd rather have a longer break and start early than have a shorter break and be late
- being on time to get started but then starting late because people needed to get coffee
- not huge fan of standup

## 3. What would help us if we'd add/change it?
- potentially having a longer lunch break, especially when we're four people (this could be a additional rule)

## 4. What are interesting experiments?
- replace standup with check-in
- have two set start times
- 90 min lunch

## 5. Open questions?

## 6. Action Items
[x] replace standup with check-in
[x] change break time to 90 min in contract
[x] add check-list for lead dancer to bottom of contract (for cutting off)

## 7. Current Experiments
- 90 min lunch
