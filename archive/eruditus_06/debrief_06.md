## 1. What felt good/what worked?
- custom rule secion on contract was great for remote day and other custom rules
- longer lunches and set start times were great
- one remote day no problem
- 10 feels like great starting time
- 4 learning days stretch but good
- focus and flexible lunch worked
- learned a lot

## 2. What didn't work?
- action items from last eruditus still not finished
- sticking to some of the rules
- Saturday not a good day to do eruditus
- remote day missing out on retro not great
- motivation
- only ever meeting once a week
- the retro is going too long
- didn't get done some action items
- pressure from other commitments that make me write emails for other things

## 3. What would help us if we'd add/change it?
- upload presentations/feedback as part of the review
- challenging each other more at the recap
- keep it simple, less change, if it ain't broke, don't fix it

## 4. What are interesting experiments?
- not making airplane mode mandatory. We're in a library after all
- questioning each other/methodological progress report

## 5. Open questions?
- What is the core benefit of Eruditus?
- How do we keep it simple?

## 6. Action items
- [x] Add challenge-each-other disclaimer to the lead dancer checklist
- [x] Update rules and definitions to reflect current experiments (basically remove as much as possible)

## 7. Current experiments
- we'll have the check-in at start time, if someone is not on time, it's up to the others to decide to wait or get started
- first new eruditus learning day, have appointment to implement action items from previous sprint
- make an additional appointment for presentations
- upload presentations and debrief in debrief session
