## 1. What felt good/what worked?
- not having to get up early in the morning and having to deal with rush hour traffic
- having the Bratwurst option for lunch at the library cafe
- community topic was a LOT of fun, I was eagerly looking forward to every Eruditus
- getting more routine in preparing the presentation
- renting a book through the library system for the first time was fun and let me to
- discovering the library search engine with a lot of journal research articles and a generally huge selection
- Meeting a bit later;
- Generally really working well so much that I'm learning;

## 2. What didn't work?
- being on time (I was late I think 3 out of 5 times)
- Henry leaving for longer periods of time during learning sessions felt irritating
- Me still being late today and one other time I think.

## 3. What would help us if we'd add it?
- having a "punishment" for when someone is more than 10 min late, i.e. them having to write down why they were late as well as identifying and implementing some action they could take to prevent being late the next time
- there should be a experiment section somewhere that keeps track of experiments

## 4. What would help us if we'd delete it?
- location from the contract, not sure if it was helpful, since we're always meeting at the library and that's also in the calendar events we're creating

## 5. What would help us if we'd change it?
- meeting in the cafe instead of the coat check, that way people have to get their stuff in order, get their books ready, etc. and if someone is late that person waiting can hang out in the cafe instead of waiting by the coat check
- I think 10am will be a good time. Interested to see how that goes.

## 6. What are interesting experiments?
- The three people... now we are doing this experiment. How will that work?
- Can the other two not go in if the other isn’t there?

## 7. Open questions?
- how to deal with spontaneous trips? (suggestion: allow dance partner to agree or disagree)
- what about a situation where the phone has to be used? (airbnb guest arriving)
- what about "extra" days?
- how do we deal with experiments? Do we try them and then go back to default unless everybody wants to keep them? Or keep them unless anybody objects?
- how do we make sure action items are being done. Who does them?
- what is our vision?
- How will we handle spontaneous vacations?
- Is it important that we involve others? I feel like it's nice to have at least 3-4 so that there's a bit of community.
- How do we think of the contracts? Do we want the "apps" idea? If not, how do we resolve conflicts between different community members? Couldn't it be weird, for example, to force two people to adhere to a contract that they don't want?
- I would propose changes to the existing core contract require unanimous approval;
- Otherwise, apps";
- what is our hypothesis about what the key elements are?
  * I think it’s an appointment with another person;
  * the contract;
  * the presentation and direction that that gives;
  * the library / a nice space:
  * no internet for me;
- lateness, what’s the long-term solution?
  * one Learning: with 10am, maybe this is the only activity for the day; I shouldn't try to cram in a morning activity;

## 8. Action items
- [x] add section for current experiments
- [x] add rule in case 10 min or later to Eruditus
- [x] add additional section to contract that allow custom rules
- [x] add section to contract that makes it clear you're committed to being there on the eruditus days (showing up on the agreed upon days)
- [x] add section to rules and definitions (lead dancer is responsible for implementing action items after review and planning)
- [x] combine and upload retro feedback

## 9. Current experiments
- three people partnered up
- guest learners
- doing presentations at the end
